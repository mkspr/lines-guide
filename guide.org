* Prerequisites
<<sec:prerequisites>>
Prepare 2 terminals:
- In one of them go to your Buildroot directory - we will refer to this one as your local terminal.
- In the other one run the following:

  =minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -o=

  This will allow you to interact with the Raspberry Pi, so that's how we will call it.

* Building Linux
<<sec:build-linux>>
Do this in your local terminal

** If you're building for the first time
- =make raspberrypi4_64_defconfig=

  This will set up the default congiration for the Raspberry Pi.
- =make menuconfig=

  This command opens interactive menu, where you can change all the configuration properties; use it to change all the properties mentioned in the laboratory guide.

** Next steps (and any consequent build)
- If you want to make any changes:

  =make menuconfig=
- If you want to build the image with your changes:

  =make=

* Flashing the needed files
<<sec:flash-files>>

** Prerequisites
- Boot your raspberry pi into the rescue system (hold SW4 while powering it up)

** Flashing the rootfs [TBD]
(If Initial RAM filesystem was selected during configuration, then this is optional)

** Flashing the system image

*** In your local terminal
- =ip a= - take note of your IP address - =192.168.145.xxx=
- =cd output/images=
- =python3 -m http-server=

*** On the raspberry
- log into the system
- =mkdir /tmp/d= - create a temporary directory
- =mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /tmp/d= - mount first partition of SD card on that directory
- =cd /tmp/d/user= - go into the user directory (might be named User or Users instead)
- =wget 192.168.145.xxx:8000/Image= - copy the Image
- =wget 192.168.145.xxx:8000/.dtb= - copy the DTB

*** Reboot the raspberry
